# Travel information

## How to get to Paris?

* By plane to one of the city airports (see [a summary of the ways to travel from the city to the different airports](https://www.ratp.fr/en/visite-paris/english/getting-train-stations-and-airports)):
 - [Charles de Gaulle](https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/access/paris-charles-de-gaulle/public-transport) (CDG) in the north. From there you can reach the city by bus ([RoissyBus](https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/access/paris-charles-de-gaulle/public-transport/roissybus), [ticket information](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/orlybus-and-roissybus-tickets)) or taking a suburban train ([RER](https://www.ratp.fr/en)).
 - [Orly](https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/orly-airport) (ORY) in the south. From there you can reach the city by bus ([OrlyBus](https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/access/paris-orly/public-transport/orlybus), [ticket information](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en/tickets-fares/detail/orlybus-and-roissybus-tickets)) or taking a suburban train ([RER](https://www.ratp.fr/en)).
 - [Paris-Beauvais](https://www.aeroportparisbeauvais.com/en/passengers) is served by low-cost airlines but it is located far from the city. A [shuttle](https://www.aeroportparisbeauvais.com/en/shuttle) runs between this airport and Porte Maillot (16.90€ one-way, 29.90€ round trip).
* By [train](https://www.sncf.com/en) or bus ([Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.fr/)) from multiple destinations in Europe and within France.

## How to move around Paris?
* By public transport. The [RATP website](https://www.ratp.fr/en/visite-paris/english/visiting-paris-and-its-surrounding-areas) contains a lot of useful information on Paris public transport system (tickets, timetables…).
Paris uses a [zoning system](https://www.ratp.fr/en/visite-paris/english/preparing-your-trip-tickets-and-travel-passes-designed-you) which impacts the price of your ticket. The main venue and all events will be located in Zone 1. The second venue is located in Zone 5, but a shuttle service will be available to reach it from the city.
Here you can check Paris’ [public transportation map](https://www.ratp.fr/en/plans).
As pricing is not always clear and affluence in stations is to be expected, it is recommended to prepare your trip ahead and check the ticket you might need:
 - Transportation prices will be higher during the Olympic games season. For Zone 1, a single journey ticket will cost 4€. Reduced 10-ticket blocks (32€) as well as day (16€) and week (70€) passes will also be available ([Pass Paris 2024](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/actualites/passe-paris-2024-transport-jo)). These are valid for the subway, tram, buses and suburban trains within Paris.
 - You should note that buying tickets in advance with the [RATP app](https://www.ratp.fr/en/apps/bonjour-ratp) should give you access to [reduced fares](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/actualites/tarification-jo-paris-2024). You can also buy a [contactless card]([https://www.ratp.fr/en/titres-et-tarifs/t-ticket-navigo-easy-pass-and-telephone](https://www.ratp.fr/en/titres-et-tarifs/t-ticket-navigo-easy-pass-and-telephone "https://www.ratp.fr/en/titres-et-tarifs/t-ticket-navigo-easy-pass-and-telephone")). Avoiding paper tickets is also advised as they can be faulty and RATP agents have a tendency to fine first and let users sort it out with customer service afterward.  
 - Paris Airports are both in Zone 5, but you can easily reach the city from them. You can find how and with which ticket [here](https://www.ratp.fr/en/visite-paris/english/getting-train-stations-and-airports). Train tickets to and from the airports (ORY / CDG) will be majored at 16€ during the Olympic games.
 - Lastly, only purchase your tickets at a [RATP counter or vending machine](https://www.ratp.fr/en/where-can-i-purchase-a-ticket-or-travel-pass): re-selling fake tickets at a higher price to people queuing is a common scam.

* By bike: you can use [city bikes](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en/service) for shorter rides.

## Venue location
The symposium will take place in two different venues, les Cordeliers (in Paris) and Télécom-Paris on the Plateau de Saclay (in the outskirts). A shuttle service will be available to reach Télécom-Paris from the city.

## Accommodation suggestions
* [Jo and Joe]([https://www.joandjoe.com/paris-gentilly/en/](https://parisjetaime.com/convention/hebergement/jo-joe-paris-gentilly-pc134 "https://parisjetaime.com/convention/hebergement/jo-joe-paris-gentilly-pc134"))
We recommend staying in the south of Paris (for example in the 14th district) or in close suburbs like Montrouge or Gentilly.
We will provide a platform regrouping all participants which will allow you to discuss with fellow attendees or to find shared accommodation options, as they might be easier to find and less pricey.
